    "description": "This layer shows techniques (including techniques from software used by the groups) used by APT3 only in blue, APT29 only in yellow, and both APT3 and APT29 in green. The techniques in red denote techniques considered undetectable by a notional organization because they have no data-sources. Disclaimer: Data-sources in ATT&CK are sources of information that COULD be used to identify adversary actions, however the exactness of that evidence varies greatly. Therefore the presence of a data source for technique should only be considered a potential metric for detectability.",
